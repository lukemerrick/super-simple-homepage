##Overview

This project is a simple exercise in python templating to facilitate a somewhat updatable and customizable personal landing page that is fully static for easy hosting. The goal is to maintain *super simple* design so that users can quickly understand and completely customize where necessary.

##Updates

I do not maintain/update this code regularly, but I do post any changes I make to the code in the process of tweaking my own personal homepage. If you want to take this project and run with it, be my guest, but I bet there is probably better-written and better-documented code elsewhere on github for you to use as a starting point.

####Resources for using this code to make yourself a website

Free, ad-free hosting? 
I personally have used x10hosting.com, which has worked well for me.

Stock photos?
pexels.com has free CC0-licensed photos galore, which is what I used to mock up some sample sites!

Want a top-level domain name?
(As of the time of writing) If you’re a college student, Namecheap will give you a free .me domain! The url is nc.me 
Even if you aren’t a college student, a .com will run you about $10 every year, whereas even a basic hosting plan could cost you $5-$10 a month. In terms of bang-for-your-buck, if all you want is a super-simple homepage, this is the way to go in my opinion!
