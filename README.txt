Free, ad-free hosting? 
I personally have used x10hosting.com, which has worked well for me.

Stock photos?
pexels.com has free CC0-licensed photos galore, which is what I used to mock up some sample sites!

Want a top-level domain name?
(As of the time of writing) If you’re a college student, Namecheap will give you a free .me domain! The url is nc.me 
Even if you aren’t a college student, a .com will run you about $10 every year, whereas even a basic hosting plan could cost you $5-$10 a month. In terms of bang-for-your-buck, if all you want is a super-simple homepage, this is the way to go imho!
