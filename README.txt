Want a top-level domain name?
If you’re a college student, Namecheap will give you a free .me domain! The url is nc.me 
Even if you aren’t a college student, a .com will run you about $10 every year, whereas even a basic hosting plan could cost you $5-$10 a month. In terms of bang-for-your-buck, if all you want is a super-simple homepage, this is the way to go!
